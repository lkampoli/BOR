The testcases in this folder are named according to the following nomenclature:

'''|_fields_|_variables_|_error_|_costs_|_population_|_generations_|'''

 - fields: physical variables used in the eval_study.py (velocity, reynolds_stress, wall_shear_stress) 
 - variables: variables used in the GEP training 
 - error: metric used in the GEP training
 - costs: how many cost functions are used (C1, ...Cn)
 - population: how many individuals are used for a single gene
 - generations: number of generations used for the GEP training

Here, we consider only the BOW region.
